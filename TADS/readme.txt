 Introduction
==============

This script attemts to interpret a binary TADS archive and decompile the
information stored within to something resembling the source code for it.
The resulting output would be the property of the orginial author and should
not be mis-used in any way.

I make no claim to being a great perl-scripter or binary decoder, so you 
should not expect the output source code to actually compile back to the 
original game, but it should atleast be legible.

 Installation
==============

As this is a Perl script, you need a local Perl installation to run it.
Executing the script will give you an up-to-date listing of the available
flags.

  References
==============

Daniel Schepler's detads script was my initial inspiration and source for the
TADS2 file structure.
Gargoyle's source code provided needed pointers to some missing opcodes.
The TADS3 technical documentation is invaluable at describing the T3 format.
